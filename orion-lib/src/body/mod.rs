//! Middleware that applies a timeout to requests.
//!
//! If the request does not complete within the specified timeout it will be aborted and a `408
//! Request Timeout` response will be sent.
//!
//! # Differences from `tower::timeout`
//!
//! tower's [`Timeout`](tower::timeout::Timeout) middleware uses an error to signal timeout, i.e.
//! it changes the error type to [`BoxError`](tower::BoxError). For HTTP services that is rarely
//! what you want as returning errors will terminate the connection without sending a response.
//!
//! This middleware won't change the error type and instead return a `408 Request Timeout`
//! response. That means if your service's error type is [`Infallible`] it will still be
//! [`Infallible`] after applying this middleware.
//!
