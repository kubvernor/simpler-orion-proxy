## Introduction

Orion Proxy is a high performance and memeory safe implementation of popular [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). Orion Proxy is implemented in Rust using high-quality open source components. 

### Key features

**Memory Safety**

Rust programming language allows to avoid a whole lot of bugs related to memory memory management and data racess making Orion Proxy a very robust and secure application.  


**Performance**

Orion Proxy offers 2x-4x better throughput and latency than Envoy Proxy. Refer to [Performance](docs/performance/performance.md) to see performance figures and how tested Orion Proxy for more details.  


**Compatibility**

Orion Proxy configuration is generated from Envoy's xDS protobuf definitions. Orion Proxy aims to be a drop in replacement for Envoy.
