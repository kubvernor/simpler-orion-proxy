## Introduction

Orion Proxy is a high performance and memory safe implementation of popular [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). Orion Proxy is implemented in Rust using high-quality open source components. 
Orion Proxy has been mostly implemented at Huawei Ireland Research Center and released to pulicly at [Gitee Orion Proxy](https://gitee.com/orion-proxy/orion).
### Key features

**Memory Safety**

Rust programming language allows to avoid a whole lot of bugs related to memory management and data races making Orion Proxy a very robust and secure application.  


**Performance**

Orion Proxy offers 2x-4x better throughput and latency than Envoy Proxy. Refer to [Performance](docs/performance/performance.md) to see performance figures and for more details how we tested Orion Proxy .  


**Compatibility**

Orion Proxy configuration is generated from Envoy's xDS protobuf definitions. Orion Proxy aims to be a drop in replacement for Envoy.
